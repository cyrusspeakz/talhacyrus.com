Make the decision, never the choice.

Somewhere, somehow, life can be experienced with full self-expression and on terms decided by you. This is the life that I seek. I am on this voyage documenting the ups and downs with these emails.

Trust and believe I know how frustrating life can be, especially as a survivor.

- Working hard, seeing little results.
- Emotionally overwhlemed, constantly at war.
- Intellectually drained, too many problems to solve.
- Fighting off the old habits that no longer serve you.
  
Yep, been there doing all of that! Don't worry you get better managing and clearing the clutter over time for my newbies. 

As a survivor you have done the trauma work, congratualations! Now, you are at the starting line and itâ€™s time to take on life with a new understanding and perspective of self.

Don't do it alone the lone wolf lifestyle is disasterous long-term. I recently decided to end living this way, hence the newsletter.
