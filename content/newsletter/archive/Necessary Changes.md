As-Salaam Alaikum (Peace Be Upon You),

It has been some time since you have heard from me and I ask for your forgiveness. This past Ramadan has been one I will never forget, extremely challenging and unexpectedly enlightening. This was an experience that I could never have prepared myself for…

A lot has changed within me!

I will go into much more detail in a follow-up email to be sent out later this week. Read through the update notes and prepare for a much more impactful newsletter.

As always, thank you for your time and feedback. The emails I received in response to my newsletters have been amazing to read! 

*Sincerely,  
Talha ibn Cyrus*

Thank you.
