There will continue to be experiences in life when our options are non-existent.

We become paralyzed.

Panic overtakes us.

A need arises...

To move.

To do.

To act.

There’s nothing to be done in this state.

Instead of brute-forcing your way through these experiences.

**STOP!**

Get still.

Sit down.

Breathe.

A way forward will reveal itself to you, but you must be silent enough in mind and body to receive it.

I’m asking you today, to practice, to train, to be still, and listen to self.

*Sincerely,  
Talha ibn Cyrus*
