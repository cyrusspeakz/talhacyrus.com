Move forward.

Make action your friend.

Every step forward no matter how small is one towards your personal greatness. 

Never allow the darkness of the unknown to stop you. 

**To hold you hostage.** 

The direction of our fears often holds the answers to our problems.

So you must step forward. 

Into the darkness you go, as you will become your own light. 

All that is ever needed on the path toward greatness is the courage to take the next step.

*Sincerely,  
Talha ibn Cyrus*
