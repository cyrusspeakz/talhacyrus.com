You are allowed. 

You are allowed to be. 

You are allowed to exist. 

You are allowed to strive for more. 

You are allowed to tell them no.

You are allowed to bet on yourself. 

You are allowed to be selfish. 

You are allowed to be angry. 

You are allowed to be upset. 

You are allowed to be who you are. 

You owe no one but yourself.

*Sincerely,  
Talha ibn Cyrus*
