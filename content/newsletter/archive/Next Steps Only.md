You only need to know your next step.

Trust your instincts.  

That part of you that urges you to move.

**Listen to it!**

This is your inner compass.

There will be plenty of time to plan and get your bearings.

But FIRST, you MUST get momentum.

You need to become comfortable stepping further and further away from your prison.

Out into the world of what's possible.


*Sincerely,  
Talha ibn Cyrus*
