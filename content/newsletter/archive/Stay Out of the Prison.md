It's mind over matter.   
And you need to win.

Your prison is NOT your home.   
Your environment does not control you.

You have survived. You are alive.   
You are on a voyage to greatness, to happiness, to peaceful discomfort.Â 

**All by your own design.**

Do not allow your environment to dictate who you are.

*Sincerely,  
Talha ibn Cyrus*
