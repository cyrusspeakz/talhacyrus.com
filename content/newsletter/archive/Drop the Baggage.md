The past week has been a lesson in faith…

To not see the way forward and to only have the vision of lays in front of you.

This has been an extremely frustrating experience for me. As I progress forward there is always a comfort in knowing what is next.

Though, with my refreshed understanding of my conative thinking. I moving in ways that have been foreign to me for some time.

Natural, yet foreign.

It has been a gruelling time of sacrifice.

While fasting this Ramadan, I strive to shed many parts of me that no longer serve my present and in-turn future.

Far too often we drag along people, things, beliefs, and habits that weigh us down.

Drop the dead weight.

Drop it all.

All at once or piece by piece, the weight MUST be dropped.

This is how we best move forward.

As clear space in our lives, we make room for new.

Embrace the new.

Stay out of the prison of your mind.

*Sincerely,  
Talha ibn Cyrus*
